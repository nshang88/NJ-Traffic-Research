Data: The department of New Jersey provide the summary of the traffic crashes data from 2001-2019 at https://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/accident/crash_statistics.shtm  for each counties (21 total)  of the state.

On the other hand, it is worth noting that the Kaggle website provides a 3 million traffic accidents of US from February 2016 to December 2020 at https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents. But the estimation by the NHTSA says that 6 million car accidents happen in the U.S. every year, 3 million cases in almost 5 years is only a small portion of the total accidents. If we look closer at the state of NJ, the Kaggle dataset provided 8,435 cases in year of 2019 while the DOT of NJ reported 276,861 accidents. The sampling ratio is only 3.05%. If we look at each county, it become even more problematic. As the graph below shows, the sampling ratio from each county varies significantly: the lowest is Sussex County, only 1.15% of the cases were sampled into the Kaggle dataset, the highest is Warren County with a 11.3% ratio. My conclusion is the Kaggle dataset is good for practice of the machine learning skills but not good for the real data project research.
